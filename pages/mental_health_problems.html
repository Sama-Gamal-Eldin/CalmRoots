                These mental health problems vary in severity and impact, and their causes can be complex, including

                combination
                of medication, psychotherapy, and support from healthcare professionals and loved ones. Early
                intervention
                and ongoing management can significantly improve outcomes and quality of life for individuals
                experiencing
                mental health challenges.
